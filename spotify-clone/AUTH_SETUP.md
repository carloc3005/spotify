# Authentication Setup Instructions

## Database Setup (Required for Email/Password Authentication)

Since you're using Neon PostgreSQL, you need to complete these steps:

### 1. Set up your DATABASE_URL
Add your Neon database connection string to your `.env.local` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL="your-neon-postgres-connection-string"
```

### 2. Run the database migration
Once you have your DATABASE_URL set up, run this command to add the hashedPassword field:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-hashed-password
```

### 3. Generate Prisma client
After the migration, regenerate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```
